## CRITICAL!

- Currently unable to make blog Chapter work :/ 

- Homepage needs to be established. This might be solvable with the help of looking into how JS injections work?

- Need to learn the technology still. LOOK AT YOUR GOALS AND TODO LIST!

## Resolution! 
> Issue #1
>> I don't understand why only the first 2 pages i created are working but none of my other pages! I'm assuming that it is related to the default settings so I will have to explore that! In the mean time, panic! But not really.
>
>**Solution**: turning `draft=false` in the markdown headers allowed the site to be present again. This could be due to the fact that i'm currently in developer mode so that way it's not focusing on pages that are meant for deployment? Not sure - will need to conduct some thorough reserach on this?
>
>**Follow Up**: Look into why this matters? I think it's related to config files or maybe development/deployment?
